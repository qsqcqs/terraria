# terraria
paying money is an L, just make the game yourself
also I hate how terraria needs a mouse because
like I use a laptop and a mouse doesnt really have
a nice place to go, plus all my cabled mice are
broken and while my one bluetooth mouse does work,
I really just keep it at home for aforementioned 
reasons, also my mouse aim is shit and terraria
seems complicated with its huge wiki and shit so
like fuck it, I'm not paying to be confused and
ultimately have a good time, just get this and
have a miserable time for free
